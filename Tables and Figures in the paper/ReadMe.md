The files in this folder are named accroding to the table numbers in the paper.

### 1. Table i, i = 1:5

These folders hold the R and MATLAB files (for IF-PCA only) that should reproduce the results for table i in the paper.

### 2. Table 6

To replicate table 6 in the paper, use the files in the folders 'RNA Seq Data', 'Cardio Data' and 'Multitissue Data'. Note that you will have to convert the csv file 'selected.csv' to a .mat file yourself.
