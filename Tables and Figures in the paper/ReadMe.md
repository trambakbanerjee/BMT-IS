The files in this folder are named accroding to the table numbers in the paper.

### 1. Table i, i = {1:5} U {7,8}

These folders hold the R and MATLAB files (for IF-PCA only) that should reproduce the results for Table i in the paper. 

### 2. Table 6

To replicate Table 6 in the paper, use the files in the folders 'RNA Seq Data', 'Cardio Data' and 'Multitissue Data'. Note that you will have to convert the csv file 'selected.csv' to a .mat file yourself. 

Some of these folders, especially those of Tables 8 and 6, do not contain the actual data files due to size limitations. Please send me an email if you would like to have them.
